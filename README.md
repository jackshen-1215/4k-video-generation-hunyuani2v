# 4k-video-generation (HunyuanVideo-I2V)

This repository contains a pipeline for 4K video generation based on [HunyuanVideo-I2V](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V).

**Instructions:**
- Download the full HunyuanVideo-I2V repository from [here](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V).
- Follow the official instructions in that repository to set up the environment and dependencies.
- Use the provided `pipeline_hunyuan_video.py` as needed for your 4K video generation tasks.
- The current pipeline file in the repo is not working as intended, the author is still resolving some bugs (e.g., tensor size mismatching for the RoPE function) and will update this repo as they are resolved :)
